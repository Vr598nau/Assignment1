        <p>Electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic materials play a crucial role in accelerating and controlling electrochemical reactions, which are essential for various applications in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis. These materials possess unique properties that enable them to efficiently catalyze and facilitate electron transfer during electrochemical processes. Their design and optimization hold significant potential for advancing clean energy technologies, sustainable chemistry, and environmental remediation. Continued research and development in these areas are critical for realizing a more sustainable and low-carbon future.</p>
        <p>This Special Issue is proposed in order to provide and share recent research and developments on novel electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic materials for the high-value conversion of small molecules, as well as on their synthesis, characterization, properties, and simulations. The contributions in this Special Issue will be of great interest to researchers working in the field of electrocatalytic and electrosynthetic materials. Therefore, we welcome research works from scientists, engineers, and industries in these fields.</p>
